This is a living document that will be updated with more links as we discover them, feel free to recommend stuff, bonus points (not really) if you use GitHub to do it!

Every folder in this repo is something we covered in a particular class, make sure to click into the folder to see a detailed readme describing what we did in Unity and linking directly to the scripts we wrote.

You can clone this repo and run the scenes we made too!
